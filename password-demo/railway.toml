# DEPRECATED: Railway config has moved to the project root
# See /railway.toml for the active configuration
#
# This is necessary because the server depends on the pir/ crate at the project root,
# so the Docker build context must be the project root to access both directories.
#
# If you need to configure Railway manually:
# - Set Root Directory to empty (use repo root)
# - The Dockerfile path will be: password-demo/Dockerfile
